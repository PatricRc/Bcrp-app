## Completed Features

- Nxt.js frontend scaffolded with Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Lucide-based sidebar
- Supabase project set up with PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, and Prisma ORM schema
- Integrated Gemini 2.5 Pro API with secure proxy for Explore & Chatbot modules
- RAG pipeline initialized: OpenAI embeddings stored in Supabase for chatbot queries
- Explore & Analyze UI complete with live API fetch for BCRP series (no mocks)
- CSV and PDF export functionality working in Explore and Playground views
- Initial caching logic in place to persist valid BCRP API responses in Supabase

## Remaining Tasks

- Implement Playground chart logic using daily/monthly/yearly indicator combinations
- Finalize PDF exports using real-time rendered results
- Improve indicator metadata display (units, frequency, descriptions)
- Apply RLS (Row-Level Security) on Supabase tables
- Mobile responsiveness: optimize navigation and data display on small screens

## Upcoming Priorities

- Build dashboard logic to visualize daily indicators (`PD04650MD`, `PD12301MD`, etc.)
- Set up scheduled sync jobs (daily/monthly/yearly) for real-time BCRP API pulls
- Load test chatbot with large embedding corpus using real economic documents
- Finalize frontend alerting and error-handling for API unavailability

## Current Project Status
**Phase**: End-to-end feature completion  
**Progress**: ~75% complete  
**Target Launch**: MVP by end of Q2  

## Known Issues / Risks

- Gemini API quota may require backend retry logic or billing tier upgrade
- Charting performance on low-powered devices needs optimization
- BCRP API rate limits may throttle high-frequency queries (scheduling essential)
- RAG chatbot needs strict input sanitization for non-economic prompts

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

ðŸš« No mock data.  
âœ… Only real BCRP API responses or previously cached valid data are allowed in all views and modules.
